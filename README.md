This project focuses on developing transparent machine learning models to evaluate credit risk. The goal is to create interpretable models that provide insights into the factors contributing to credit risk assessment, ensuring transparency and fairness in decision-making.
- Utilized Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Linear Regression for transparent modeling.
- Applied LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) on top of a simple Decision Tree to enhance interpretability.
- Conducted PCA to reduce feature dimensionality and plotted 2D visualizations with different SVC kernels.
- Addressed class imbalance using SMOTE and monitored overfitting when tuning hyperparameters.
BUSINESS VALUE: Provides transparent, interpretable, and fair credit risk models that enhance regulatory compliance, improve decision-making, and build customer trust while reducing operational risk and increasing model auditability.
